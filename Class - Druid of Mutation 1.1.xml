			<p>Druids of the Circle of Mutation believe that nature should be improved in order to compete with the unnatural world. Their order hides in the darkest corners of swamps and forests, conducting experiments to warp the structure of their domain.</p>
			<p class="indent">They go unheard from for months on end, emerging from the wild with twisted vines and mutated creatures at their side. These druids have earned the scorn of other circles, discredited as those who have lost their way. In the eyes of a mutation druid, those who wish to preserve nature as it is simply fear what change brings.</p>

			<p>Starting when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can use a bonus action to use your Wild Shape.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend a spell slot and gain a number of mutation points equal to the level of the spell slot expended. These mutation points last until they are spent or your use of Wild Shape ends. While you are in your beast shape you can expend one or more mutation points (no action required by you) to select a mutation from the list below. When you do, your physical body contorts and changes in a gruesome display.</p>
            <p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Creature of the Sea.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, you can breathe air and water and gain a swim speed of 30 feet. For an additional 1 mutation point, your swim speed increases to 60 feet.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Creature of the Sky.</em></strong> For 3 mutation points, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet. For an additional 2 mutation points, your fly speed increases to 60 feet.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, you gain darkvision out to a distance of 60 feet.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Echolocation.</em></strong> For 4 mutation points, you have blindsight out to a distance of 30 feet while you are not deafened.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Enchanted Attacks.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, your attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Enlarge.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, your size increases by one step (from Medium to Large, for example). You can spend an additional 2 mutation points to increase your size by two steps instead (from Medium to Huge, for example).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> For a number of mutation points equal to 2 + 2 x your beast form’s CR, whenever you use your action to make a natural weapon attack you can make two natural weapon attacks instead.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> For 1, 2, or 3 mutation points you increase your AC by an equal amount.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Reduce.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, your size decreases by one step (from Medium to Small, for example). You can spend an additional 2 mutation points to decrease your size by two steps instead (from Medium to Tiny, for example).</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Unnatural Voice.</em></strong> For 1 mutation point, you can speak as normal, even if your beast shape lacks the anatomy for such vocalizations. This does not allow for spellcasting while in Wild Shape form.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"><strong><em>Venomous Attacks.</em></strong> For 2 mutation points, attacks you make with your natural weapons deal an additional 1d4 poison damage.</p>
